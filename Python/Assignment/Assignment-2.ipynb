    "# based on the number of years an employee has been working. It also offers bonuses for \n",
    "# employees who have more than 15 years of experience. \n",
    "# Scenario Breakdown: \n",
    "# Context 1: Senior Employee \n",
    "# ● An employee with 10 or more years of experience is classified as a Senior \n",
    "# Employee. The base salary for such an employee is 80000. \n",
    "# ● If the employee has more than 15 years of experience they receive a bonus of \n",
    "# 5000 to their salary. \n",
    "# Example: \n",
    "# An employee with 18 years of experience: \n",
    "# ● They are classified as Senior Employees. \n",
    "# ● Their base salary is 80000. \n",
    "# ● Since they have more than 15 years of experience they receive an additional \n",
    "# 5000 bonus. \n",
    "# ● The final salary is 85000. \n",
    "# Context 2: Mid-Level Employee \n",
    "# ● Employees with 5 to 9 years of experience are classified as Mid-Level \n",
    "# Employees. \n",
    "# ● Their base salary is 50000 with no bonus. \n",
    "# Example: \n",
    "# An employee with 7 years of experience: \n",
    "# ● They are classified as a Mid-Level Employee. \n",
    "# ● Their base salary is 50000. \n",
    "# ● Since they have fewer than 10 years of experience no bonus is added. \n",
    "# ● The final salary is 50000. \n",
    "# Context 3: Junior Employee \n",
    "# ● Employees with less than 5 years of experience are classified as Junior \n",
